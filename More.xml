            &lt;p id="TfjWJF"&gt;Venom is on his way to the big screen... again. &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/17/14955464/spider-man-villain-venom-standalone-movie-october"&gt;Sony reportedly has a movie starring the Spidey villian scheduled for an October 2018 release&lt;/a&gt;, even though the studio currently shares custody of Spider-Man with Marvel. We don’t know much about what’s planned, but we do know that a script is already in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DMc2fn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Venom is Spider-Man’s Bizarro&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p id="2ykUPw"&gt;I’m a huge Spider-Man fan, so I know a little bit about the character and what he represents. Since he has the same abilities but lacks a moral compass, he’s essentially the wall-crawler’s Bizarro. As such, it’s hard to imagine a standalone movie that doesn’t have Spider-Man show up in some way. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p id="4LUWPv"&gt;There are a few obvious hurdles: since Marvel has just rebooted Spider-Man, Venom’s movie will need to be...&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;

            &lt;p id="MwZiit"&gt;Unlike the Nintendo Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/product/hirise-iphone"&gt;Twelve South’s HiRise 2 iPhone stand&lt;/a&gt; is not exactly new. But, as the company’s enterprising marketing team has discovered, it is perhaps the best-looking solution for standing up your Nintendo Switch while charging it at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p id="I2vRJ2"&gt;While using Nintendo’s own charging dock only allows you to play the Switch on a connected screen, using the built-in kickstand results in a flimsy setup that blocks the USB-C port on the bottom, the HiRise 2 solves all of those problems, allowing you to charge the Switch while standing it up on a desk and still allowing you to play it. The matte black aluminum design also looks rather nice when paired with Nintendo’s console, too. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p id="Tl3BE8"&gt;Another benefit: the stand doesn’t block the...&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p id="enO7hy"&gt;One of the many things I liked about my last phone, the HTC One, was its lock screen weather widget. In a world of full-featured, minute-by-minute weather apps, it didn’t offer much: just the current temperature, the day’s projected high and low range, and an icon that indicated sun, rain, or snow. But it did exactly what I wanted. I could hit the power button on my way out the door and instantly gauge whether I should be grabbing a heavy coat or a light jacket, and whether I should worry about rain soaking my shoes. I retired the One last year, and months after switching to a shiny new Pixel, I’m constantly asking myself: why won’t Google let me do the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p id="D9bWLj"&gt;Google clearly understands that weather widgets are an inordinately...&lt;/p&gt;
