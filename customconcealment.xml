            &lt;p id="MryxKF"&gt;Apple quietly pushed an update to its AppleCare+ smartphone insurance program today that extends the purchase window for iPhones from 60 days to one year. The change, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/17/applecare-plus-iphone-one-year-to-purchase/"&gt;reported first by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed with a support rep, is not yet showing up on Apple’s official product page for AppleCare+. But if you go to &lt;a href="https://checkcoverage.apple.com/"&gt;Apple’s eligibility tool&lt;/a&gt; and input your serial number from the iPhone’s settings panel, you should be able to see a new purchase option so long as you purchased the device within the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p id="7WZgWR"&gt;This now means iPhone insurance through Apple has the same purchase window as Macs and the Apple TV, but the Apple Watch and iPad are still restricted to 60 days after purchase. Considering Apple &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/7/12841248/apple-cheap-iphone-screen-replacement-applecare"&gt;lowered the price of screen repairs...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p id="MwZiit"&gt;Unlike the Nintendo Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/product/hirise-iphone"&gt;Twelve South’s HiRise 2 iPhone stand&lt;/a&gt; is not exactly new. But, as the company’s enterprising marketing team has discovered, it is perhaps the best-looking solution for standing up your Nintendo Switch while charging it at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p id="I2vRJ2"&gt;While using Nintendo’s own charging dock only allows you to play the Switch on a connected screen, using the built-in kickstand results in a flimsy setup that blocks the USB-C port on the bottom, the HiRise 2 solves all of those problems, allowing you to charge the Switch while standing it up on a desk and still allowing you to play it. The matte black aluminum design also looks rather nice when paired with Nintendo’s console, too. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p id="Tl3BE8"&gt;Another benefit: the stand doesn’t block the...&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p id="enO7hy"&gt;One of the many things I liked about my last phone, the HTC One, was its lock screen weather widget. In a world of full-featured, minute-by-minute weather apps, it didn’t offer much: just the current temperature, the day’s projected high and low range, and an icon that indicated sun, rain, or snow. But it did exactly what I wanted. I could hit the power button on my way out the door and instantly gauge whether I should be grabbing a heavy coat or a light jacket, and whether I should worry about rain soaking my shoes. I retired the One last year, and months after switching to a shiny new Pixel, I’m constantly asking myself: why won’t Google let me do the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p id="TfjWJF"&gt;Venom is on his way to the big screen... again. &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/17/14955464/spider-man-villain-venom-standalone-movie-october"&gt;Sony reportedly has a movie starring the Spidey villian scheduled for an October 2018 release&lt;/a&gt;, even though the studio currently shares custody of Spider-Man with Marvel. We don’t know much about what’s planned, but we do know that a script is already in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DMc2fn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Venom is Spider-Man’s Bizarro&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p id="2ykUPw"&gt;I’m a huge Spider-Man fan, so I know a little bit about the character and what he represents. Since he has the same abilities but lacks a moral compass, he’s essentially the wall-crawler’s Bizarro. As such, it’s hard to imagine a standalone movie that doesn’t have Spider-Man show up in some way. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p id="4LUWPv"&gt;There are a few obvious hurdles: since Marvel has just rebooted Spider-Man, Venom’s movie will need to be...&lt;/p&gt;
